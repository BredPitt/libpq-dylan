This library wraps ``pq``.

To do a build, use ``make`` so that the appropriate steps
are executed. Make sure that you have ``pg_config`` on the
path.

You will also need a build of ``melange`` from the
``opendylan-melange`` repo installed in ``~/Open-Dylan/bin``.

See the TODO for a more complete list of issues to be
addressed.
